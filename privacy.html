    <p> We have only read access to the user emails and we do not store them anywhere. We implement a online read through of the
        emails and create a checklist on the fly without requiring any post data utilization. The custom checklist built will be used by the user
        to fulfill their tasks. We make API calls to gmail application to receive emails in a readonly fashion from which content will be extracted to
        create the checklist that will be provided to user through the alexa skill we develop.
